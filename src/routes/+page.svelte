		Welcome to the <strong>ðŸš€ Unofficial Classroom Availability Checker ðŸš€</strong> for the University
		of Bologna!
	</p>
	<p>
		Since the University doesn't offer a system to check the availability of classrooms, this
		website was created to assist students in locating <strong>free spaces for studying</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		We <strong>don't scrape</strong> the university's website, but instead rely on the data provided
		by the university itself via some hidden but <strong>public</strong> APIs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Actually, it's your browser that makes the HTTP requests to the servers, so we're not doing
		anything at all. We're just providing a nice interface to the data. ðŸ˜¼
	</p>
	<div class="flex not-prose gap-4">
		<a href="#calendars" class="not-prose btn btn-primary grow"> CALENDARS </a>
		<a href="/aule" class="not-prose btn btn-secondary mx-auto grow"> CLASSROOMS </a>
	</div>

	<hr />

	<p>
		Please note that the API could be changed / removed at any time, so this website could stop
		working without notice. We're not responsible for any inconvenience caused by the unavailability
		of the service.
	</p>

	<p>
		The website is being served on the <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a> free tier and is
		available at: <a href="https://uniboaule.vercel.app/">uniboaule.vercel.app</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/VaiTon/uniboaule/">GitHub</a>.
		Please feel free to inspect, fork, and contribute to the project. Or use it as a base for your
		own project. That's the beauty of open source! ðŸŒˆ
